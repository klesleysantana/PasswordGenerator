# Secure Password Generator (CLI)

A simple and secure command-line password generator built in **C#**, designed to create strong passwords using customizable character sets and cryptographic randomization.

## 🔧 Features

- Generate passwords of any desired length  
- Choose which character sets to include:
  - Lowercase letters
  - Uppercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters  
- Uses `RandomNumberGenerator` for cryptographically secure randomness  
- Efficient string handling with `StringBuilder`  

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user selects which character sets to include.  
2. All selected sets are concatenated into a single character pool.  
3. A password is generated by selecting random characters from the pool using `RandomNumberGenerator`.
